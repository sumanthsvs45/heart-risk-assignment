📝 Assignment: Health Risk Prediction (Mini Version)
Objective
Build a simple regression model to predict BMI based on lifestyle features using either PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Instructions
Step 1 – Dataset Generation
Create a small dummy dataset (10–15 rows) with the following features:
Sleep Hours
Daily Steps
Calories Intake
BMI (Target variable)
Step 2 – Dataset Normalization
Apply normalization (e.g., StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler) to bring features into a similar range.
Step 3 – Training Model
Build a simple regression model (Linear Regression using PyTorch or TensorFlow).
Train it on the dataset you generated.
Step 4 – Evaluation
Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
Step 5 – Prediction
Predict BMI for at least one new data sample (e.g., 7 hours sleep, 7000 steps, 2200 calories).
